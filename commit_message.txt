Fix critical architecture bugs in 6-PASS system: PASS 1 Сборник default and PASS 4 consensus protection

PASS 1: Remove Сборник default that blocks fallback mechanism
- Changed proposed_author=author or "Сборник" to proposed_author=author or ""
- Allows empty values to flow through PASS 2 and PASS 2 Fallback
- Impact: 18 records now correctly use metadata as fallback instead of being stuck as Сборник

PASS 4: Protect metadata-sourced authors from consensus overwrite
- Fixed apply_author_consensus() to exclude "metadata" source from consensus processing
- Changed 'other_records' to 'undetermined_records' to only include unattributed files
- Added clear source tracking: folder_dataset, filename, metadata are all "determined"
- Impact: Files like "Лидин, Серебряная" keep metadata authors instead of being overwritten

Additional fixes:
- Improved validation order in filename extraction (blacklist check BEFORE known author words)
- Added regex patterns for multi-author format (Author, Author. Title)
- Added "СССР" to blacklist words to prevent false author extraction

Fixes these specific issues:
✓ Жеребьёв files: Now extract "Владислав Жеребьёв" from filename (not Сборник)
✓ Логинов. СССР: Now extracts "Логинов" (blacklist protects from СССР noise)
✓ Лидин, Серебряная: Now uses metadata "Александр Лидин; Татьяна Серебряная"

Test results: 672 files processed, CSV shows 654 (97%) from filename, 18 (3%) from metadata
